An actual library
	Shared library is preferable (for using with all my tools)

C code without a main function, compile with -c
use all the .o files in the ar tool to make an archive file

look into cmake (specific for making different output types? - library, program, etc)
	+++

Cmdline runner
	support these cmdline args
		load
		mem
		apitest -- check to make sure all the call are implemented / acting vaguely correcting (sanity test)
			-- garbage input returns correct errors
		exec
		cache	-- enables caching (needed to add to API)


Interrupts
