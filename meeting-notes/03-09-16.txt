GUI or GDB stub?
	GUI
		would have to do disassembly in the GUI (my job)
	GDBStub * Mr. J likes
		GDB Client / Host thingy does disassembly on its own
			single step
			can be easy gui
		would require implementing an interface (mapping network strings to methods / commands)
		2 Threads
			Runner (execute(1) and check if need to stop)
			GDB nw / cli thread
		Look for good GUI frontends
